Sharetime is a social media app similar to Instagram developed in Android Studio
and written in Kotlin.
The app architecture includes one main activity, where 1 of 7 fragments gets hosted
depending on the users demand and navigation. The UI is developed using view
binding and referring to the Material Design guidelines.
It uses Firebase as backend service for data and database storage and
authentication.
