This project was developed for a Deep Data in Deep Space course of my studies,
which was an elective with a lecturer from NASA. Our idea was to create an easy to
use online application, where various data can be visualized. A large amount of data
is downloaded from the network via a Python FTP client and then deployed via a
Node Express.js API to be callable for the frontend. The frontend is built with React,
Redux, Deck.gl and Mapbox. The application was developed as first prototype, and
has ideas to become bigger and include more data and visualization capabilities.
