Huntz was my Bachelor project for my Bachelor studies that got developed during the final semester.
Together with 3 colleagues we decided that we want to create a digital version of a treasure hunt game.
One can CREATE and PLAY a location-based treasure hunt with our app. So, the Game Loop consits of a location hint, where one must find the real location (it gets evaluated with the GPS coordinates) and after the location was found, a task needs to be solved. After the task is completed, the next location hint will be given.
The app is published as PWA, thus available on all platforms. It is build with Next.js in the frontend, an GraphQL API implemented with C#/.Net Core and PostgreSQL as database and containerized with Docker.
I was mainly responsible for the frontend setup, the frontend logic and implemented few things in the backend.
We used Jira/Confluence as a project management tool and tried to stick to the Git Flow during development.
