This website was developed with React, Redux and TypeScript in the Frontend and
the Solr Search Engine. It collects all the offers from Austrian supermarkets (Hofer,
Lidl, Penny, Spar) and makes them searchable. Therefore, the data is scraped with
Playwright from the official supermarket websites and then imported as JSON objects
into the Solr Search Engine. The deployment is automated with GitHub Actions.
