This project was developed as a semester project for my studies in my first year.
It uses the WebVR Framework Aframe.io and PHP as developing language.
It upgrades the 2D website of the portfolio to the 3D world by displaying the projects
in exhibition rooms where one can walk through using the keyboard or the mouse.
