This project was developed during one week as a semester project for my studies in
my second year.
It uses Ruby on Rails on the backend and JavaScript, SCSS for the frontend.
The idea is to provide a platform for planning and executing a treasure hunt together
with others by creating different tasks that are mapped to a specific location, similar
to a scavenger hunt in the real world.
Everybody who joins the same route/game is able and should participate in planning.
When every player is ready the game can start, where we than use Web Sockets to
get a real-time game-flow. The rally starts by giving the first location hint.
