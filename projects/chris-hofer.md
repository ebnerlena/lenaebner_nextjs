This project's aim was to build a homepage for a singer called Chris Hofer.
It is hosted with WordPress and developed as a own Theme from scratch.
Unfortunately, it is a fictional project that was created for the CMS course of my
studies.
We used Timber as a templating language, advanced custom fields and Contact Form 7.
