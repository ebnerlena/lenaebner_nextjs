This project was developed during the Human-Computer-Interaction lecture for my studies.
The problem we tried to solve is: `How do we help people manage the (food) ingredients in their fridge so they can reduce their personal food waste?`. As our first solution we created an application that offers integrated food recognition and thus reduce personal food waste. We help to recognize ingredients and visualise them in the app according their expiry date.
Currently the concept and a working clickable prototype are available. For a real implementation research has to be done, as we would need a good algorithm for the food recognition and a lot of material to train the algorithm.
