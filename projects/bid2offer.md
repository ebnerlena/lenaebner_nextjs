This project was developed during a project week for my studies as MMP2b with 4 colleagues. The
focus was on the frontend, which is built with React. In the backend we were using
Google Firebase services (real time database, deployment and functions).
This app is a reverse approach of the classical way of finding offers. While normally a
client should ask multiple businesses and look after offers in different places, the app
aims to simplify all this process and bring businesses and clients on one platform.
Clients can generate auctions for certain services they want to acquire and choose
the best-bidden price, while the businesses can bid their services to the client.
